🧠DSA Sheet Repository










💬 About This Repository

Welcome to Sayan’s DSA Sheet Repository — the sacred arena where I fight logical battles, tame pointers, and occasionally win against segmentation faults ⚔️💻.

This repo is a growing collection of DSA problems I’ve solved (or tried to) while sharpening my programming skills in C/C++/Python. Expect arrays, linked lists, recursion, sorting, and maybe some tears of debugging 🧩😭.

I upload each problem as I solve it — some out of passion, others out of sheer panic before deadlines 😅.

⚡ Fun Fact

Most of these codes were born between 1 AM – 3 AM, fueled by coffee, chaos, and compiler errors ☕💀.
If you spot something wrong — it’s not a bug, it’s a feature 😎

🚀 Keep Coding!
